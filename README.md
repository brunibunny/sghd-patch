# SGHD Patch - HQ Audio

A fork of CoZ's [SGHD Patch](https://github.com/CommitteeOfZero/sghd-patch/) with HQ audio tracks for all FMVs.

Should be used with my HQ FMV project.

Build instructions can be found on the original repo, but you probably won't need that.

Check the [Steam thread](https://steamcommunity.com/app/412830/discussions/0/2798319091587142247/) for more information.
